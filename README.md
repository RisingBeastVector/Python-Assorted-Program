# Python-Assorted-Program
Assorted Python Programs created by me for exploring the dynamics of Python language.

## **Instructions** :
> Use ***"Run Python File"*** to run a Python program in VS code. This will open VSc Terminal and then provide input to the program and there itself get output from the program.

> Use _"Run Code"_ to run a Python program which has only output and no inputs.
